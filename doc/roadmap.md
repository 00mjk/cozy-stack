Introduction
============

This roadmap is not a prediction on what will be made when. It's just a tool
to think about what should be made be coded and in what order. It can also be
used to track the progress.

But it's not realistic. In particular, I've prefered to put one subject per
sprint with the whole team on it. But, of course, the development won't happen
like that: the team can be split to work on several subjects and a subject
will progress on several sprint.

Like I said, this roadmap is to help see how things can be done, not an
operational tool.
