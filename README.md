## What is Cozy?

![Cozy Logo](https://raw.github.com/cozy/cozy-setup/gh-pages/assets/images/happycloud.png)

[Cozy](https://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space.  With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own
hardware where no one profiles you.


## And what about this repository?

This repository contains thoughts for a new version of Cozy Cloud which aims
to be simpler for hosting thousands of instances. You can find:

- [some notes about the architecture](doc/architecture.md)
- [a draft of a possible roadmap](doc/roadmap.md)
- some code in Go to help me immerse in the new architecture
