## Instance

An instance is a logical space owned by a user and identified by a domain. For
example, zoe.cozycloud.cc can be the cozy instance of Zo√©. This instance has a
space for storing files and some CouchDB databases for storing the documents
of its owner.

## Environment

When creating an instance, it's possible to give an environment, `dev`, `test`
or `production`. The default apps won't be the same on all environments. For
example, in the `dev` environment, some devtools will be installed to help the
front developers to create their own apps.

## Cozy Stack Mode

The cozy stack can run in several modes, set by a UNIX environment variable:

- `production`, the default
- `test`, for running the unit and integration tests
- `dev`, for coding on the cozy stack.

This mode is used to show more or less logs, and what is acceptable to be
displayed in errors.

Even if the Cozy Stack Mode and Environment have the same values, they are not
the same. The Cozy Stack Mode will be used by core developers to hack on the
cozy stack. The environment will be used by front developers to hack on cozy
apps.
